// TODO:
// Exercise 2:
// Implement greated common divisor using constexpr, such that it can be evaluated at compile time.
// Your implementation should use variadic templates, to enable calling it
// with any number of arguments, ensure that at least two arguments are provided.
//
// Exercise 3:
// Implement minimum common multiple using constexpr, such that it can be evaluated at compile time.
// As with GCD, your implementation should use variadic templates, to enable calling it
// with arbitrary number of arguments, but at least two
//
// Exercise 4:
// Implement power using template metaprogramming. The template struct must be
// called `Power`, and be callable with `Power<base, exponent, modulus>::value`.
// I.e. it needs a compile time evaluation `value`, which holds the result of
// the computation.
// Think about your base cases
